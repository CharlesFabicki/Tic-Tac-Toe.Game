## How to Play

Tic-Tac-Toe is a two-player game where the objective is to get three of your symbols (either 'X' or 'O') in a row, column, or diagonal on the game board. Here's how you can play:

- Player 'X' starts the game.
- Players take turns placing their symbol in an empty cell on the game board.
- The first player to get three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal wins.
- If the entire board is filled without a winner, the game ends in a tie.

## Features


- **GUI Mode**: Play the game using a graphical user interface (GUI) for an interactive gaming experience.
- **Win Detection**: The game checks for a win or a tie and announces the result.
- **Error Handling**: Prevents invalid moves in the GUI mode.
- **Restart**: Restart the game after a win or a tie.
